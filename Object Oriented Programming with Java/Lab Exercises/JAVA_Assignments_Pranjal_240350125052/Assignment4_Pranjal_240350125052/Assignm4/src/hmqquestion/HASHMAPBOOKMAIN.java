import java.util.HashMap;
//This line tells the Java compiler to include a specific part of Java's standard library, specifically the 
//HashMap class. A HashMap is a data structure that organizes items in key-value pairs, allowing for 
//efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of elements.

//This line imports the Scanner class from Java's standard library.The Scanner class provides methods to
