Armstrong Axioms
Definition:- Armstrong's axioms are a set of references (or, more precisely, inference rules) used to infer all the functional dependencies on a relational database.

Axioms:-
1. Axiom of Reflexivity:- If A is a set of attributes and B is a subset of A, then A contains B. This feature is an unimportant feature.
2. Axiom of Augmentation:- If A→B is valid and Y is a built-in character, AY→BY is also valid. In other words, adding new features to success does not change success. If A→B becomes AC→BC for C.
3. Axiom of Transitivity:- According to the law of substitution in algebra, if A→B holds and B→C holds, so does A→C. A→B is a function called A that determines B.


Secondary Rules
Union: If A→B holds and A→C holds, then A→BC holds. If X→Y and X→Z then X→YZ.
Composition: If A→B and X→Y hold, then AX→BY holds.
Decomposition: If A→BC holds then A→B and A→C hold. If X→YZ then X→Y and X→Z.
Pseudo Transitivity: If A→B holds and BC→D holds, then AC→D holds. If X→Y and YZ→W then XZ→W.
Self Determination: It is similar to the Axiom of Reflexivity, i.e. A→A for any A.
Extensivity: Extensivity is a case of augmentation. If AC→A, and A→B, then AC→B. Similarly, AC→ABC and ABC→BC. This leads to AC→BC.


Armstrong Relation:- The Armstrong relation can be defined as a relation that satisfies all functions in the F+ closure. The size of the minimum Armstrong relation in a dependency set is an exponential function of the number of features present in the dependency calculation.


Advantages of Using Armstrong’s Axioms:-
They provide an effective and efficient way to identify additional efficiencies throughout the business process that can help improve the production process.
Dependencies that help remove unnecessary information and improve database performance. relationship.


Disadvantages of using Armstrong's Axioms:-
The process of extracting additional functional dependencies using Armstrong's axioms can be expensive, especially for large databases with many tables and relationships. relationship between products.
The axioms do not take into account the semantic meaning of data, and may not always accurately reflect the relationships between data elements.


When do we use Armstrong Axioms?
We use the Armstrong Axioms when making work-related decisions in the library. Generally, it is used to use a particular function to export another function in the repository.
