Lock-Based Concurrency Control
Definition:- Lock-based concurrency control (BCC) is used to control multiple processes accessing the same data object. This process helps maintain data consistency and integrity across multiple users. In this agreement, the business is locked into the equipment to control their access and prevent mutual conflicts of interest.

Lock-Based Protocol:- A lock is a variable associated with an object that describes the state of the data object with respect to possible operations that can be applied to it. They synchronize access to database objects through transactional operations. The system requires all information to be entered into a unified system.

Graph-Based Protocol:- In graph-based concurrency control, processes are represented as nodes in the graph, and conflicts between processes are represented as edges of the nodes. A conflict occurs when two processes access the same data object and at least one of the processes performs a write operation.

Time-Stamp Ordering Protocol:- The main idea of ​​the system is to sort the work according to the specified time. The hours in which the transaction occurs become serializable, and the same serial balance is allowed if such transactions are determined based on their hourly value. Simply put, plan a special order that corresponds to the order of changing hours. The algorithm must ensure that the order in which items are entered does not violate the order for any items entered in a conflicting operation in the plan.

Multiple Granularity Protocol:- Multiple granularity means breaking the database process into pieces that can be locked and track what needs to be locked and how. Such a hierarchy can be represented graphically as a tree.
