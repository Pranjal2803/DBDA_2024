Entity–relationship model (ER model)

Definition:- A relational model is a representational model used to define the entities to be represented in the data and how these entities are related. ER data model specifies a business schema that graphically represents the entire structure of the data. A spatial relationship diagram describes the relationship between entities in the database. ER models are used to model real objects (such as people, cars, or companies) and relationships between objects in the world. In short, ER diagram is a data structure.


Entity:-
An Entity may be an object with a physical existence – a particular person, car, house, or employee – or it may be an object with a conceptual existence – a company, a job, or a university course.

Entity Set:-
An Entity is an object of Entity Type and a set of all entities is called an entity set.

Types of Entities:- 
1. Strong Entity
2. Weak Entity

Strong Entity:- A strong place is a place with important qualities. Strong associations do not depend on other places in the schema. It has a key to help identify it and is represented by a rectangle.

Weak Entity:- An Entity type has a key attribute that uniquely identifies each entity in the entity set. But some entity type exists for which key attributes can not be defined.

Attributes:-
Attributes are the properties that define the entity type.


Why Use ER Diagrams:- 

1. ER diagram is used to represent the E-R structure in data, making it easier to convert them into relationships (tables).
2. ER diagrams aim to model things in the real world, which makes them useful.
3. ER image does not require technical knowledge or hardware support.
4. These charts are very easy to understand and easy to create even for new users.
5. It provides a standard solution for visualizing data.


Symbols Used in ER Model:- 

Rectangles: Rectangles represent Entities in the ER Model.
Ellipses: Ellipses represent Attributes in the ER Model.
Diamond: Diamonds represent Relationships among Entities.
Lines: Lines represent attributes to entities and entity sets with other relationship types.
Double Ellipse: Double Ellipses represent Multi-Valued Attributes.
Double Rectangle: A double Rectangle represents a Weak Entity.


How to Draw an ER Diagram?

The first step is to identify all the areas and place them in a rectangle and label them accordingly.
The next step is to identify the relationships between them, assign them based on diamond usage, and make sure the relationships are not interconnected.
Place the items in the right places.
Get rid of objects and relationships.
Add the appropriate color to highlight items in the library.


Generalization, Specialization, and Aggregation in ER Model

Generalization:-
Generalization is the process of extracting common features from a group of entities and creating general entities from them. It is a bottom-up method by which two or more sites can become higher sites if they share some common characteristics. Generalization is simply gathering the common properties from entities and creating a generalized concept from those extracted data. Generalization helps in improving the flexibility, and reusability of the database.

Specialization:-
In specialization, an entity is divided into sub-entities based on its characteristics. It is a top-down approach where the higher-level entity is specialized into two or more lower-level entities.

Aggregation:-
An ER diagram cannot represent the relationships between organizations and relationships that may be needed in certain situations. In these cases, the relationship with the mutual organization rises to higher levels. Aggregation is an abstract system in which we can represent relationships as higher-level entities.
