Redundancy
Definition:- Redundancy means having multiple copies of the same data in the database. This issue occurs when the database is not normalized. Let's assume the student's detailed information is: student number, student name, school name, university ranking and course selection.

1. Insertion anomaly
2. Deletion anomaly
3. Updation anomaly


Insertion anomaly:- An append exception means that data cannot be appended to the file because the relevant data is incomplete or incomplete.
Deletion anomaly:- A deletion exception occurs when you delete a file that may contain attributes that should not be deleted.
Updation Anomaly:- Bad changes are caused by data redundancy and data inconsistencies due to partial updates.


Problems Caused Due to Redundancy:- 

1. Changes in uncertainty: Duplication can lead to unsustainable changes, where changes made to one copy of the product will not affect other copies. This may lead to incorrect use of information in the decision-making process, as well as errors and inconsistencies in the information.
2. Performance issues: Redundancy can cause performance issues because it takes more time for the database to update multiple copies of the same data. This will slow down data recovery and slow down all data processing.
3. Security issues: Duplication can create security issues because unauthorized users can access and use multiple copies of the same file. This may lead to information being disclosed and compromising the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information.
4. Maintenance complexity: Redundancy increases the complexity of database maintenance because many copies of the same data must be updated and synchronized. This will make troubleshooting and troubleshooting more difficult and may require more time and resources to manage storage.
5. Data duplication: Redundancy leads to data duplication, where the same data is stored in multiple locations, wasting storage space and increasing complexity. This can also be confusing and inaccurate, as copies of different products may produce different or inconsistent results.


Disadvantages of Redundant Data:-
Inconsistency: If the same information is stored in different places in a database, there is a risk that updates or changes made in one copy of the information will not appear in other copies, becoming inconsistent and inaccurate.
Maintenance is not easy: Data is duplicated, making it difficult to maintain the accuracy and consistency of data. It takes more effort and resources to ensure that all copies of the document are updated correctly.
Risk of error: When data is repeated, the risk of error in the data is greater. For example, if the same data is stored in more than one table, there is a risk of inconsistency between tables.

Advantages of Redundant Data:- 
Improve query performance: Redundancy helps speed up data retrieval by eliminating the need for complex connections.
Offline access: Unlimited copies allow data access while offline, even without a constant connection.
Improve availability: Redundancy helps improve redundancy and allows data access even in case of server failure.
