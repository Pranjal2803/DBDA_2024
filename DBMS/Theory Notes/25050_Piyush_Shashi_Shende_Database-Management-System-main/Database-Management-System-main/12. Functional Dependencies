Functional Dependencies
Definition:- Functional dependency (FD) in a database management system (DBMS) is a simple concept that describes the relationship between attributes (columns) in a table. It shows that the price of one or more energies determines the price of other goods. For example, an FD can be between a primary key (PK) in a table and another non-primary key.


Advantages:-
It can help identify suspicious activity and eliminate obstacles to reducing data duplication and improving data performance.
It ensures data consistency by identifying all combinations that can be found in the database.
It can help improve data creation by identifying equivalent business processes that can be used interchangeably.

Disadvantages:-
The balance of work does not necessarily reflect the semantics of the data and does not necessarily reflect the actual relationship between data points.
This process will require workplace testing of large numbers of candidates; This can be time consuming and difficult.
The process of determining workload balance can be expensive, especially for large data sets.
