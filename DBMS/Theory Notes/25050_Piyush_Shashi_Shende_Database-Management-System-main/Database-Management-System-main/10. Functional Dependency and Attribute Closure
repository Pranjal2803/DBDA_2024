Functional Dependency and Attribute Closure

Functional Dependency:- A function in the A->B relation is valid if two tuples that have the same value for property A also have the same value for property B. Functional Dependencies in a relation are dependent on the domain of the relation.

Disadvantages of Functional Dependencies
The process of identifying functional dependencies can be time-consuming and difficult, especially in large databases with many tables and relationships.
The data is inconsistent because the data that should be linked may not have been linked correctly.
The process does not include the meaning of the data and may not always reflect the relationship between the data.

Advantages of Functional Dependencies
They help reduce duplication of information in the database by identifying and eliminating unnecessary or irrelevant information.
They improve data integrity by ensuring information is accurate and consistent across the database.
It makes it easy to add, edit, and delete data, which helps database management.

Functional Dependency Set:- The functional set or FD layer of the relationship is the set of all FDs present in the relationship.


Attribute Closure:- Having the property closed can be described as an efficient business decision. the set of attributes that can be functionally determined from another set of attributes. It's represented as X+, where X is the set of attributes.

Disadvantages of Attribute Closure:-
The process of calculating implicit behavior can be very expensive, especially for large data sets.
The closed character does not contain the meaning of the data and may not always reflect the relationship between the data.

Advantages of Attribute Closure:-
The registration tool helps in identifying all possible products that can be obtained from a particular product.
They make data creation easier by defining relationships between attributes and tables that help refine queries.
They ensure data consistency by identifying all combinations of attributes present in the data.


Prime and Non-Prime Attributes
Attributes that are part of each candidate's key relationship are called primary attributes, and other attributes are called non-primary attributes.
