Denormalization
Definition:- Denormalization is a process that improves data reading performance by adding regular data or groups of data. This method eliminates normalization rules to reduce the number of joins required to provision the equipment. However, denormalization will result in the exchange of written and read data.


Pros of Denormalization:-
Improve query performance: Normalization can improve query performance by reducing the number of connections required to retrieve data.
Reduce complexity: Denormalization, which aggregates relevant data into fewer tables, can simplify database structure and make it easier to manage. Easier maintenance and Updates: Denormalization makes it easier to update and manage data by reducing tables.
Improve readability: Denormalization can improve readability by making data more accessible. Better scalability: Denormalization can improve the scalability of the database system by reducing the number of tables and improving overall performance.

Cons of Denormalization:-
Reduce data integrity: Denormalization by adding redundant data reduces data integrity and increases the risk of inconsistency.
Complexity: Although denormalization can simplify the database architecture in some cases, it can also complicate it by adding unnecessary data.
Increasing storage requirements: Denormalization increases storage requirements by continuously adding data and increases the cost of data management.
Update and maintenance are not easy: Denormalization increases the difficulty of updating and maintaining data by restoring data.
Limiting simplicity: Denormalization reduces the variability of the database structure by adding redundant data and making it difficult to change the schema.
