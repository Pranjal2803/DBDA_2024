Types of Keys in Relational Model

1. Candidate Key
2. Primary Key
3. Super Key
4. Alternate Key
5. Foreign Key
6. Composite Key
7. Unique Key


Candidate Key:-
This is the minimum key.
It is a super key that contains no duplicate data, called the adversary's key.
The smallest set of criteria that can be used to describe specific data.
It must have certain values. It can have NULL values.
Every table must have at least one candidate key.
A table can have many candidate keys but only one key.
Candidate key values ​​are unique and can be null for tuples.
There will be many important rivals in the relationship.

Primary Key:-
A primary key in DBMS is uniquely identifying each record or row within a table.
This is a private key.
It only recognizes one tuple (one file) at a time.
It has no equal, it is unique. It cannot be NULL.
The primary key does not have to be a single column; many rows can act as primary keys of the table.

Super Key:-
The set of properties that uniquely identify a tuple is called a super key.
Adding zero or more characters to the candidate key creates a superkey.
The candidate key is the super key but has not been modified.
Super Key values ​​can also be NULL.

Alternate Key:- 
Keys that are not primary keys are called secondary keys.
Any key other than the primary key is called an alternate key.
This is a modified key.
Contains two or more fields to describe two or more documents.

Foreign Key:- 
A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables.
It acts as a cross-reference between tables because it references the primary key of another table, thereby establishing a link between them.
If an attribute can only be derived from values ​​that occur in other attributes, then it will be a foreign key to the attribute it references.
The relationship is called a relationship and the corresponding behavior is called a reference behavior.
The use of social behavior should be a priority. or multiple relationships (tables).

Composite Key:- 
A composite key is a candidate key that consists of two or more attributes, (table columns) that together uniquely identify an entity occurrence (table row).
If there is no primary key in the table, it becomes a secondary key or a composite key is created by using several properties together.
The combination of different attributes can provide different accuracy on different lines.

Unique Key:-
A unique key is a key that uniquely identifies the data in a table.
It differs from a primary key in that a unique key can have a NULL value, but a primary key cannot have a NULL value.

Artificial Key:- 
False keys are keys used when none of the attributes have all the attributes of the primary key or when the primary key is large and complex.
Dummy keys are additional properties that the user can see in the table but are not present.
It can analyze its own syntax or check its code.
